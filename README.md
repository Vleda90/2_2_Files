When studying lists, we wrote a program that allows you to describe the queue of visitors - and enter the name, surname and age of the visitor sequentially.
Rewrite the program so that when launched it offers two modes
read information from a file (then you need to enter the file name and the program should display the data on the screen)
enter new data (and then when the input is complete - the program not only displays the information on the screen, but also offers to save the information to a file. In this case, you must further enter the file name.)
(difficult) Think about how to modify the program so that it controls the format of the file that needs to be opened? How should the program behave if the file format does not match the expected one? How should the program behave if the file name for saving the data already exists?
Modify the program according to your understanding of solving the problems posed.
